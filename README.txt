TouchBadge is a new way to network. 

Conferences exist to cater to almost every industry, and some companies hold conferences
 entirely dedicated to their own customers. Theses events are prime locations for networking
 with other people in the industry as well as potential customers. For vendors at these events,
 conference badges are an important tool as they allow for the collection of attendee data for
 future contact. TouchBadge looks to bring that kind of experience to every conference attendee.
 Working with hardware partner Breadware, Inc., we are developing TouchBadge, a smart conference
 badge. TouchBadge allows the transfer of contact information between attendees wirelessly and without
 an external reader. Once obtained, contacts are stored in the cloud for later retrieval and are
 exportable to the users customer relationship management (CRM) software of their choice.
